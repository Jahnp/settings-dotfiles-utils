# autohotkey-scripts
This repo contains my personal [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) hotkeys/bindings. This began as a motivation to find a way to add some of Mac OS X's Emacs-like global keyboard shortcuts (like Control-f) on Windows.

These shortcuts help me navigate text quickly without my hands leaving home row, so with no "official" implementation in Windows, I use AutoHotKey to simulate them.
